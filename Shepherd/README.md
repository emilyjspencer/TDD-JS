As a shepherd
So my sheep can be safe
I want to have a pen they can go into

As a shepherd
So my sheep can be friends
I want them to be able to say their names


As a shepherd
So I can know all my sheep are home
I want to get a list of all the names of the sheep in the pen and return the number of sheep
